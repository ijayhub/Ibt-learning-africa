# Introduction to DevOps and Linux  

Our learning journey began on November 9th, and the first week was all about laying the groundwork.  

We started with **IT fundamentals**, which was a prerequisite for everything we would be learning later. This included understanding how computers and networks work, basic system administration, and other foundational skills. These concepts were essential to ensure we had a strong base before moving on to more advanced topics.  

After learning that we were welcomed **what DevOps is**. We learned that DevOps is a combination of practices and tools that help teams work together to develop, test, and deploy software quickly and efficiently. It bridges the gap between developers and operations, making the software development process smoother.  

Finally, we moved on to **Linux commands**. Since Linux is one of the most widely used operating systems in DevOps, learning how to work with it was crucial. We practiced commands to navigate directories, create and manage files, and control permissions. This hands-on practice gave us a good understanding of the basics of Linux.
