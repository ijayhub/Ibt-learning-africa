# Scripting
  
In Week 2, we learned about scripting and how to automate tasks for CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment). Automation helps save time, reduces manual work, and makes software development and deployment easier and more reliable.  

We used Python, a popular and easy-to-learn programming language, to practice scripting. Python is great for managing files, processing data, and automating tasks. We worked on simple scripts to understand how to use Python for these purposes, preparing us to apply it in real-world situations.
